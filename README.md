# Fetch Frontend Challenge

## Get Started

To run the app:
`npm install && npm run dev`

## Comments

Challenge is completed using Vite+React/TS, react-query as the client fetching library, tailwind for styling, and shadcn for the base components. For the forms base component, shadcn used react-hook-forms with zod which is nice as it has great typings and error handling.
